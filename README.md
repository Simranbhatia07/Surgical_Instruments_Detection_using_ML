# Surgical_Instruments_Detection_using_ML
A project in association with PGIMER hospital, Chandigarh. This project aims to identify and count surgical instruments on the operation theatre trolley before and after the surgery to make sure that no object is left behind in the human body after the surgery is done. This is a rare event but can cause fatal issues if occurs unintentionally too.
