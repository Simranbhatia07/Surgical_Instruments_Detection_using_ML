# Surgical_Instruments_Detection_using_ML
A project in association with PGIMER hospital, Chandigarh. This project aims to identify and count surgical instruments on the operation theatre trolley before and after the surgery to make sure that no object is left behind in the human body after the surgery is done. This rare event can cause fatal issues if it occurs unintentionally, too. 
Therefore, to avoid this event, we wrote this code to implement our project's initial stage using YOLOv4- an object detection algorithm, and Python programming.
